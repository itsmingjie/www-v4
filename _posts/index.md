**I live in the intersection of technology and education, building software, writing blog posts, and running events. **I use he/him pronouns.

<credit>I was recently featured on 21st Visionary Podcast with my co-founder Megan, where we talked about the story behind Execute Big and our view for the current CS education landscape. [Listen Here Â»](https://anchor.fm/21stcenturyvisionary/episodes/Ep-7--Megan-Cui-and-Mingjie-Jiang-on-running-a-non-profit--Adapting-to-COVID-19-and-the-CS-Ed-landscape-eftsae)</credit>

I'm currently attending the College of Letters and Science at **UC Berkeley** as a first-year student while also busy building:

- [**Execute Big**](https://executebig.org): a non-profit organization aiming to remove barriers of entry to technology for students of underrepresented demographics. We are currently **[researching](https://research.executebig.org/)** on how to improve CS education programs and increase representation of underrepresented minorities and women in CS.
- **[Infinity](https://github.com/itsmingjie/infinity)**: an open-source mystery puzzle hunt server written to redeem myself after a [sysops meltdown](https://medium.com/@integirls/this-was-integirls-puzzle-hunt-2020-1a646e908858#:~:text=The%20HUNT,then%20rolled%20out%20our%20new%20platform.).
- **[CodeLabs](https://labs.codeday.org/)**: planning the future of the virtual internship program for everyone. 
- **[M3TA](https://m3ta.io)**: the hackathon for hackathon organizers driven by the community; coming 2021.
- ... and smaller [side-projects](https://github.com/itsmingjie) to keep my downtime occupied.
